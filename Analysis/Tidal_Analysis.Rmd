# Introduction
This notebook and related notebooks document analysis of data derived from a
multi-year deployment of ocean acidification monitoring equipment at the
Southern Maine Community College pier, in South Portland, Maine.

The monitoring set up was designed and operated by Joe Kelly, of UNH and his
colleagues, on behalf of the Casco Bay Estuary Partnership.  This was one of the
first long-term OA monitoring facilities in the northeast, and was intended to
test available technologies as well as gain operational experience working with
acidification monitoring.

In this Notebook, we develop  analyses of tidal patterns, looking both at
patterns with the daily tides and with spring tide-neap tide cycles.

# Load Libraries

# Color Palette
For Seasonal Displays.  This is just a list, not a function, like cbep_colors().
```{r color_palette}
season_palette = c(cbep_colors()[1],
                    cbep_colors()[4],
                    cbep_colors()[2],
                    'orange')
```

# Load Data
## Establish Folder References
```{r folder_refs}

```

The following loads existing data, including a "temperature corrected" pCO~2~
value based on Takahashi et al. 2002. It then collapses that data to daily
summaries.

(See the "Data_Review_And_Filtering" R Notebook for details on why and how we 
calculated temperature-corrected pCO~2~ values.)

## Read Data
We add the Month and Season factor here for use in later graphics.

Note that the original time coordinate here is in UTC, not local time. But by
default, read_csv() interprets times according to the locale, here Eastern
Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Time, depending on time of year.  I have not
found an easy way to alter that behavior, but the force_tz() function in
lubridate can fix it. Once that happens, the time is in UTC, and we can express
it in for time zone by changing the 'tzone' attribute.

For analysis of the impact of tides, the main thing is to make sure that both 
the tide data and the OA data use the SAME time coordinate.  We use Local 
Standard Time.

```{r load_data} 
all_data <- read_csv(fpath,
                     col_types = cols(dd = col_integer(), 
                                      doy = col_integer(),
                                      hh = col_integer(),
                                      mm = col_integer(),
                                      yyyy = col_integer())) %>%
  mutate(datetime = force_tz(datetime, tzone = 'UTC')) %>%
  
  # Calculate local standard time coordinates
  mutate(stdtime = structure(datetime, tzone = 'Etc/GMT+5')) %>%
  mutate(yyyy  = as.numeric(format(stdtime, format = '%Y')),
         mm    = as.numeric(format(stdtime, format = '%m')),
         dd    = as.numeric(format(stdtime, format = '%d')),
         doy   = as.numeric(format(stdtime, format = '%j')),
         hh    = as.numeric(format(stdtime, format = '%H')),
         Month = factor(mm, levels=1:12, labels = month.abb)
         ) %>%
  mutate(Season = recode_factor(mm, 
                                `1`  = 'Winter',
                                `2`  = 'Winter',
                                `3`  = 'Spring',
                                `4`  = 'Spring',
                                `5`  = 'Spring',
                                `6`  = 'Summer',
                                `7`  = 'Summer',
                                `8`  = 'Summer',
                                `9`  = 'Fall',
                                `10` = 'Fall',
                                `11` = 'Fall',
                                `12` = 'Winter'
                                ))
```


# Prepare Tidal Data
## Revised Folder References
```{r folder_refs_2}
sibfldnm <- 'Original_Data'
subfolder <- 'Tides_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
sibling  <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)
neice <- file.path(sibling, subfolder)
fn = 'portland_HiLo_tides.csv'
fpath <- file.path(neice,fn)
```

## Read Tides Data
Here we are dealing with NOAA's API.  We downloaded the data in "local standard
time", but we face the same problem we did importing temporal data for time of
day (above).  The function read_csv implicitly imports time data in local clock
time.  We need to convert to Standard Time.
```{r load_tide_data}
tide_data <- read_csv(fpath, 
                       col_types =
                        cols(Date = col_skip(),
                             DateTime = col_datetime(format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"), 
                             Time = col_skip())) %>%
  rename(stdtime = DateTime, wl = `Water Level`, type = Sigma) %>%
  mutate(stdtime = force_tz(stdtime, tzone = 'Etc/GMT+5'))
```

### Data Correction
The tide data downloaded from the NOAA API lacks tide entries for leap day in
2016. Looking data up on the (NOAA page for the Portland Tide
Gage)[https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/waterlevels.html?id=8418150&units=standard&bdate=20160229&edate=20160229&timezone=LST&datum=MLLW&interval=hl&action=]
for the Portland tide station, we find that High and low tides on that day were
(local standard time):

Level | Time  | Elevation
______|_______|__________
  HH  | 03:00 | 9.3
  L   | 09:24 | 1.32
  H   | 15:30 | 8.48
  LL  | 21:30 | 1.15
  
We add those to the tides data by hand.
```{r data_correction}
tide_data <- tide_data %>%
  add_row (stdtime = ISOdatetime(2016,2,29,3,0,0, tz = 'Etc/GMT+5'),
           wl = 9.3, type = 'HH', .after=1639) %>%
  add_row (stdtime = ISOdatetime(2016,2,29,9,24,0, tz = 'Etc/GMT+5'),
           wl = 1.32, type = 'L', .after=1640) %>%
  add_row (stdtime = ISOdatetime(2016,2,29,15,30,0, tz = 'Etc/GMT+5'),
           wl = 8.48, type = 'H', .after=1641) %>%
  add_row (stdtime = ISOdatetime(2016,2,29,21,30,0, tz = 'Etc/GMT+5'),
           wl = 1.15, type = 'LL', .after=1642)
```

## Tidal Amplitudes Data
### Daily Tidal Amplitudes
Next, we calculate the observed daily tidal range for each day in the study 
period.  We use this later to analyze the impact of tidal amplitude on OA 
parameters.
```{r daily_amplitude}
amplitude_data <- tide_data %>%
  mutate(d = as.Date(stdtime)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = wl) %>%
  select(-stdtime) %>%
  group_by(d) %>%
    summarise(hh = mean(HH, na.rm=TRUE),
              h  = mean(H, na.rm=TRUE),
              ll = mean(LL, na.rm=TRUE),
              l  = mean(L, na.rm=TRUE),
              .groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate(range = ifelse(is.na(hh), h, hh) - ifelse(is.na(ll),l,ll)) %>%
  select(-c(hh,h,ll,l)) %>%
  mutate(yyyy = as.numeric(format(d, format = '%Y')),
         Month = factor(as.numeric(format(d, format = '%m')),
                        levels=1:12, labels = month.abb),
        Season = recode_factor(Month, 
                                Jan  = 'Winter',
                                Feb  = 'Winter',
                                Mar  = 'Spring',
                                Apr  = 'Spring',
                                May  = 'Spring',
                                Jun  = 'Summer',
                                Jul  = 'Summer',
                                Aug  = 'Summer',
                                Sep  = 'Fall',
                                Oct  = 'Fall',
                                Nov  = 'Fall',
                                Dec  = 'Winter'
                                )
         )
```

### Medians of Observational Data
We also need to calculate daily medians of the OA data parameters.
```{r add_daily_medians}
tmp <- all_data %>%
  mutate(d = as.Date(stdtime)) %>%
  group_by(d) %>%
  summarize_at(c('ph', 'co2', 'co2_corr', 'temp', 'sal', 'do'), function(x) median(x, na.rm = TRUE))

amplitude_data <- amplitude_data %>%
  left_join(tmp, by = 'd') %>%
  filter(! (is.na(ph) & is.na(co2) & is.na(co2_corr)))
rm(tmp)
```

## Time Since High Tide Data
We use a function provided in base R called "findInterval."

You might think of findInterval() it as a function that assigns values to values 
in the first list to bins defined by values in the second list.

For our use, we put the list of all times in the first parameter, and the list
of ONLY high tides in the second parameter.  The function will figure out which
interval (defined by values in the second list, our high tides) each value in
the first list belongs to.  The function returns a list of the INDEXES of the
"closest but smaller" value in the second list. We then use those indexes to
look up the times associated with those indexes, matching each observation with
the time of the previous high tide.
```{r time_since_high}
hightide_data <- tide_data %>%
  filter(type =='H' | type == 'HH')

tidal_data <- all_data %>%
  mutate(tideindex = findInterval(all_data$stdtime, hightide_data$stdtime)) %>%
  mutate(tideindex = ifelse(tideindex==0, NA, tideindex)) %>%
  
  mutate(tidetimes = hightide_data$stdtime[tideindex],
         hrssincehigh = as.integer(difftime(stdtime,tidetimes,units = 'hours')),
         minssincehigh = as.integer(difftime(stdtime,tidetimes,units = 'mins')))
```

### Deviations From Average Within a Tidal Cycle
Finally, we need to calculate how much each observation differs from the average
value of all observations that have occurred since the prior high tide.  We can
do that based on the tide indexes too.
```{r deviations_from_tidal_cycle_average}
tidal_data <- tidal_data %>%
  group_by(tideindex) %>%
  
  # Calculate sample sizes for each tide
  mutate(co2_n      = sum(! is.na(co2)),
         co2_corr_n = sum(! is.na(co2_corr)),
         ph_n       = sum(! is.na(ph)),
         omega_n   = sum(! is.na(omega_c))) %>%
  
  # Calculate centered but not scaled values, tide by tide
  mutate(co2_res      = scale(co2, scale = FALSE),
         co2_corr_res = scale(co2_corr, scale = FALSE),
         ph_res       = scale(ph, scale = FALSE),
         omega_res    = scale(omega_c, scale = FALSE)) %>%
  ungroup(tideindex) %>%
  
  # Replace data from any tides with less than 8 hours of data with NA
  mutate(co2_res      = ifelse(co2_n>=8, co2_res, NA),
         co2_corr_res = ifelse(co2_corr_n>=8, co2_corr_res, NA),
         ph_res       = ifelse(ph_n>=8, ph_res, NA),
         omega_res    = ifelse(omega_n>=8, omega_res, NA)
         ) %>%
    
  # Remove the sample size variables
    select(-co2_n, -co2_corr_n, -ph_n, -omega_n)
```

## Cleanup
```{r cleanup_data}
rm(all_data, hightide_data, tide_data)
```

# Analysis of Time Since High Tide
## PCO~2~ Analysis
### Initial Graphic
We fit a simple model, that fits a GAM smoother (cyclic cubic spline) to time 
since high tide, WITHOUT accounting for autocorrelation.

Note also that we do not include linear predictor main effects for the seasons
here.  That is because we know, *a priori*, that the average deviation from
daily averages is zero, so there is no intercept term.

```{r tidal_pco2_graphic_cyclical, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(tidal_data, aes(minssincehigh, co2_corr_res)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.05, color = cbep_colors()[5]) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(color = Season),
              method = 'gam', formula = y ~s(x, bs='cc'),
              se = FALSE) +
  
  theme_cbep(base_size= 12) +
  theme(legend.key.width = unit(0.25,"in"),
        legend.text      = element_text(size = 8)) +
  
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 180, 360, 540, 720),
                     labels = c(0, 3, 6, 9, 12)) +
  
  scale_color_manual(values = season_palette, name = '') +
  geom_text(aes(x = 60, y = 200, label = 'Falling Tide'), hjust = 0) +
  geom_text(aes(x = 480, y = 200, label = 'Rising Tide'), hjust = 0) +
  
  xlab('Hours Since High Tide') +
  ylab(expression (atop(Corrected~pCO[2]~(mu*Atm), 
                        Difference~From~Tide~Cycle~Average))) 
```

### GAM Model
```{r pco2_gam}
system.time(pco2_gam <- gam(co2_corr_res ~  s(minssincehigh, by = Season, bs='cc'),
                 data = tidal_data))
```

```{r draft_gam_summary}
summary(pco2_gam)
```

```{r gam_check}
gam.check(pco2_gam)
```
Other than extremely heavy tails, I see nothing here that suggests any major 
pathologies to this model.  The heavy tails are expected with high temporal 
autocorrelation. 

#### Autocorrelation
```{r autocorrelation}
pacf(resid(pco2_gam))
```
We have significant autocorrelation, on the order of phi = 0.6.

```{r cleanup_2}
rm(pco2_gam)
```

### GAMM with Autocorrelation
This took about 20 minutes to run.
```{r gamm_pco2, cache = TRUE} 
# we run out of memory if we don't use a grouping
system.time(pco2_gam <- gamm(co2_corr_res ~  s(minssincehigh, by = Season, 
                                               bs='cc', k=6),
                 correlation = corAR1(form = ~ 1 | Season),  
                 data = tidal_data))
```

```{r summary_pco2_gamm_gam}
summary(pco2_gam$gam)
```

```{r summary_pco2_gamm_lme}
summary(pco2_gam$lme)
```

### Generate Predictions from GAMM Model
```{r predicts_pco2}
newdat <- expand.grid(minssincehigh = seq(0, 12.5*60),
                    Season = c('Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall'))
p <- predict(pco2_gam$gam, newdata = newdat, se.fit=TRUE)
newdat <- newdat %>%
  mutate(pred = p$fit, se = p$se.fit)
```

### Create Ribbon Graphic
The ribbon plot shows approximate 95% confidence intervals for the GAMM fits by
season.
```{r pco2_ribbon, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(newdat, aes(x=minssincehigh, y=pred, color = Season)) + #geom_line() +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = pred-(1.96*se),
                  ymax = pred+(1.96*se),
                  fill = Season), alpha = 0.5,
              color = NA) +
  
  theme_cbep(base_size= 12) +
  theme(legend.key.width = unit(0.25,"in"),
        legend.text      = element_text(size = 8)) +
  
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 180, 360, 540, 720),
                     labels = c(0, 3, 6, 9, 12)) +
  
  scale_fill_manual(values = season_palette, name = '') +
  
  xlab('Hours since High Tide') +
  ylab(expression (atop(Corrected~pCO[2]~(mu*Atm), Difference~From~Tide~Cycle~Average)))
```

## pH Analyses
### Initial Graphic
We fit a simple model, that fits a GAM smoother (cyclic cubic spline) to time 
since high tide WITHOUT accounting for autocorrelation.
```{r tidal_ph_graphic_cyclical, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(tidal_data, aes(minssincehigh, ph_res)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.05, color = cbep_colors()[5]) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(color = Season),
              method = 'gam', formula = y ~s(x, bs='cc'),
              se = FALSE) +
  
  theme_cbep(base_size= 12) +
  theme(legend.key.width = unit(0.25,"in"),
        legend.text      = element_text(size = 8)) +
  
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 180, 360, 540, 720),
                     labels = c(0, 3, 6, 9, 12)) +
  
  scale_color_manual(values = season_palette, name = '') +
  geom_text(aes(x = 60, y = 0.15, label = 'Falling Tide'), hjust = 0) +
  geom_text(aes(x = 480, y = 0.15, label = 'Rising Tide'), hjust = 0) +
  
  xlab('Hours Since High Tide') +
  ylab(expression (atop(pH, Difference~From~Tide~Cycle~Average))) 
```

Visually, the pattern is far less clear here than for pCO~2~. 

### GAM Model
```{r ph_gam}
system.time(ph_gam <- gam(ph_res ~  s(minssincehigh, by = Season, bs='cc'),
                 data = tidal_data))
```

```{r gam_summary_ph}
summary(ph_gam)
```

All four seasonal patterns are judged unlikely to be due solely to chance, but we 
have not yet considered autocorrelation between successive observations.

```{r check_pH_gam}
gam.check(ph_gam)
```

Other than heavy tails, I see nothing here that suggests any major pathologies 
to this model.  The heavy tails are expected with high temporal autocorrelation.

#### Autocorrelation
```{r autocorrelations_ph_residuals}
pacf(resid(ph_gam))
```
We have significant autocorrelation, on the order of phi = 0.5.

### GAMM with Autocorrelation
This took about 5 minutes.
```{r gamm_ph, cache = TRUE} 
# we run out of memory if we don't use a grouping
system.time(ph_gam <- gamm(ph_res ~  s(minssincehigh, by = Season, bs='cc', k=6),
                 correlation = corAR1(form = ~ 1 | Season), 
                 data = tidal_data))
```

```{r summary_ph_gamm_gam}
summary(ph_gam$gam)
```

```{r summary_ph_gamm_lme}
summary(ph_gam$lme)
```

### Generate Predictions from the Model
```{r predicts_ph}
newdat <- expand.grid(minssincehigh = seq(0, 12.5*60),
                    Season = c('Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall'))
p <- predict(ph_gam$gam, newdata = newdat, se.fit=TRUE)
newdat <- newdat %>%
  mutate(pred = p$fit, se = p$se.fit)
```

### Create Ribbon Graphic
The ribbon plot shows approximate 95% confidence intervals for the GAMM fits by 
season.
```{r ph_ribbon, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(newdat, aes(x=minssincehigh, y=pred, color = Season)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = pred-(1.96*se),
                  ymax = pred+(1.96*se),
                  fill = Season), alpha = 0.5,
              color = NA) +
  
  theme_cbep(base_size= 12) +
  theme(legend.key.width = unit(0.25,"in"),
        legend.text      = element_text(size = 8)) +
  
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 180, 360, 540, 720),
                     labels = c(0, 3, 6, 9, 12)) +
  
  scale_fill_manual(values = season_palette, name = '') +
  
  xlab('Hours since High Tide') +
  ylab(expression (atop(pH, Difference~From~Tide~Cycle~Average)))
```

# Analysis of Spring Tide - Neap Cycles  
A utility function for quickly looking at three different types of correlation 
coefficients.  
```{r make_fun}
threecors <- function(x,y = NULL) {
  res = list(Pearson = '', Spearman = '', Kendall = '')
  res[['Pearson']]  <- cor(x,y, use = 'pairwise', method = 'pearson')
  res[['Spearman']] <- cor(x,y, use = 'pairwise', method = 'spearman')
  res[['Kendall']]   <- cor(x,y, use = 'pairwise', method = 'kendall')
unlist(res)
}

## pCO~2~ vs Tidal Amplitude
### Graphic
```{r amplitude__graphic}
ggplot(amplitude_data, aes(range, co2_corr)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Season)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping =aes(color = Season), method = 'lm', se = FALSE) +


  theme(legend.key.width = unit(0.25,"in"),
        legend.text      = element_text(size = 8)) +
  
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 180, 360, 540, 720),
                     labels = c(0, 3, 6, 9, 12)) +
  
  scale_color_manual(values = season_palette, name = '') +
  
  xlab('Diurnal Tidal Range') +
  ylab(expression(Median~Corrected~pCO[2]~(mu*Atm)))
```

### An informal Look at Correlations
```{r pco2_amplitude correlations}
amplitude_data %>% select(range, co2_corr, Season) %>%
  group_by(Season) %>%
  summarize(correl_coef= threecors(range, co2_corr )) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(Type = rep(c('Pearson', 'Spearman', 'Kendall'),4)) %>%
  select(Season, Type, correl_coef)
```

These are fairly low correlations.  The only ones that look meaningfully (as 
opposed to significantly) correlated are for summer...

### Formal Analysis
```{r pco2_amplitude_linear_models}
the_lm <- lm(co2_corr ~ range*Season,
               data = amplitude_data, na.action = na.exclude )
the_gls <- gls(co2_corr ~ range*Season, correlation = corAR1(form = ~ d),
               data = amplitude_data, na.action = na.exclude )
the_gls_2 <- gls(co2_corr ~ range:Season, correlation = corAR1(form = ~ d),
                 data = amplitude_data, na.action = na.exclude )
```

Using the autocorrelation functions by date dramatically slows execution of the 
GLS models, compared  with using simple sequential autocorrelation, with only 
minimal changes in results.

```{r summary_pco2_amplitude_lm}
summary(the_lm)
```

This suggests we need to look at the pattern seasonally.  Summer is judged
nearly statistically significantly different from Winter, which here is the
reference level of Season.  Following good practice, that suggests we should not
try to interpret the main effect, but look instead to the seasonal effects.

However, this model does not take into account the autocorrelation between
observations, so it is likely to overstate statistical significance.  So we
compare results of a generalized least squares model.

```{r summary_pco2_amplitude_gls}
summary(the_gls)
```

This analysis, which includes consideration of the  high autocorrelation between
successive observations, suggests that the regressions lines are not
significantly different between seasons, and the main effects of range is not
statistically significant.  That suggests there is nothing here to see.

```{r summary_pco2_amplitude_gls_2}
summary(the_gls_2)
```

So, fitting four separate slopes, we also don't see statistically significant
relationships with tidal range.  The evidence is weak for an important effect of
tidal amplitude on pCO~2~ at any season.

There is a question whether removing the autocorrelation from the response,
without also addressing the autocorrelation in the predictor variable is
appropriate.  Since the predictor variable is itself highly autocorrelated, the
response will be too.  This may be imposing too strict a test.

The next step might be to fit a more complex model, which incorporates more
(time varying, autocorrelated) predictor variables, thus removing more
unexplained variation, and potentially generating a more sensitive test.

We explored several alternate GAMMs, fitting either linear or nonlinear smooth
terms for the three added predictor variables. Results (for our purposes here)
did not differ materially.  In all cases, the effect of tidal range on pCO~2~
remains statistically unimportant.

```{r pco2_aplitude_gamm,  cache = TRUE}
system.time(
the_gamm  <- gamm(co2_corr ~ range*Season + s(temp) + s(sal) + s(do), 
                  correlation = corAR1(form = ~ d),
               data = amplitude_data, na.action = na.exclude )
)
```
```{r summary(pco2_amplitude_gamm_gam)}
summary(the_gamm$gam)
```

So, that changes little. Although we see statistically significant relationships
with all three predictor variables, we see no evidence for a significant
relationship between daily tidal amplitudes and daily median pCO~2~.

Lets see what shape those relationships show.
```{r plot pco2_amplitude_gamm_gam}
plot(the_gamm$gam)
```


## pH vs Tidal Amplitude
### Graphic
```{r amplitude__graphic_ph}
ggplot(amplitude_data, aes(range, ph)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Season)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping =aes(color = Season), method = 'lm', se = FALSE) +


  theme(legend.key.width = unit(0.25,"in"),
        legend.text      = element_text(size = 8)) +
  
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 180, 360, 540, 720),
                     labels = c(0, 3, 6, 9, 12)) +
  
  scale_color_manual(values = season_palette, name = '') +
  
  xlab('Diurnal Tidal Range') +
  ylab('pH')
```

### An informal Look at Correlations
```{r correlations_ph_amplitude}
amplitude_data %>% select(range, ph, Season) %>%
  group_by(Season) %>%
  summarize(correl_coef= threecors(range, ph )) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(Type = rep(c('Pearson', 'Spearman', 'Kendall'),4)) %>%
  select(Season, Type, correl_coef)
```

These are fairly low correlations.  The only ones that look meaningfully (as 
opposed to significantly) correlated are for winter....

### Formal Analysis
```{r linear_models_ph_amplitude}
the_lm <- lm(ph ~ range*Season,
               data = amplitude_data, na.action = na.exclude )
the_gls <- gls(ph ~ range*Season, correlation = corAR1(form = ~ d),
               data = amplitude_data, na.action = na.exclude )
```

```{r summary_linear_model_ph_amplitude}
summary(the_lm)
```

There is no evidence here that tidal amplitude plays a role in pH, despite the 
moderately high correlation in winter.  This is probably because the sample size 
in winter is quite small.


```{r summary_gls_ph_amplitude}
summary(the_gls)
```

This analysis, which includes consideration of the  high autocorrelation between 
successive observations, suggests that the regressions lines are not 
significantly different between seasons. 

We fit a more complex model, which incorporates more (time varying, 
autocorrelated) predictor variables, thus removing more unexplained variation, 
and potentially generating a more sensitive test.

```{r gamm_ph_amplitude, cache = TRUE}
system.time(
the_gamm  <- gamm(ph ~ range*Season + s(temp) + s(sal) + s(do), correlation = corAR1(form = ~ d),
               data = amplitude_data, na.action = na.exclude )
)
```

```{r summary_gamm_ph_amplitude}
summary(the_gamm$gam)
```

So, that changes little.  Again, we see little evidence for a significant 
relationship between daily tidal amplitudes and daily median pH.

```{r plot_ph_amplitude_gamm_gam}
plot(the_gamm$gam)
```

## Direct Comparison Graphics For 2016 
You can not visualize these relationships if you look at four years of data -- 
the graphics are simply too compressed, so we zoom in one one period -- summer 
and fall of 2016.
