# Introduction
This notebook and related notebooks document exploratory data analysis of data
derived from a multi-year deployment of ocean acidification monitoring equipment
at the Southern Maine Community College pier, in South Portland.

The monitoring set up was designed and operated by Joe Kelly, of UNH and his
colleagues, on behalf of the Casco Bay Estuary Partnership.  This was one of the
first long-term OA monitoring facilities in the northeast, and was intended to
test available technologies as well as gain operational experience working with
acidification monitoring.

In this Notebook, we develop more revised graphics as options for Casco Bay
Estuary partnership's 2020 **State of Casco Bay** report.  We focus on
reformatting graphics related to aragonite saturation.

# Load Libraries
```{r load_libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(mgcv)

library(CBEPgraphics)
load_cbep_fonts()

library(RColorBrewer)
#display.brewer.all(n=9, type="seq", exact.n=TRUE, colorblindFriendly = TRUE)
```

# Generate Color Palettes
## Monthly
To display data by months in complex graphics, we want a 12 item sequential
color palette that's color-blind and reproduction friendly.

The rColorBrewer colorRampPalette() function creates a FUNCTION that takes the
number of colors, and returns a suitable color ramp, based on another (usually
shorter) color ramp.  Note getPalette is a FUNCTION.  We'll use this function
later to generate the colors we want on the fly.
```{r palette}
# generates a palette function from an existing color ramp
getPalette = colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(9, "YlGnBu")[2:9])  
```

## Seasonal
This is just a list, not a function like cbep_colors().
```{r}
season_palette = c(cbep_colors()[1],
                    cbep_colors()[4],
                    cbep_colors()[2],
                    'orange')
```

# Constants for Axis Labels
```{r axis_setup}
monthlengths <-  c(31,28,31, 30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31)
cutpoints    <- c(0, cumsum(monthlengths)[1:12])[1:12]
```

# Load Data
## Establish Folder References
```{r folder_refs}
sibfldnm <- 'Derived_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
sibling  <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)

fn    <- 'CascoBayOAData.csv'
fpath <- file.path(sibling,fn)

dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

The following loads existing data, including a "temperature corrected" pCO~2~
value based on Takehashi et al. 2002. It then collapses that data to daily
summaries.

> Takahashi, Taro & Sutherland, Stewart & Sweeney, Colm & Poisson, Alain &
> Metzl, Nicolas & Tilbrook, Bronte & Bates, Nicholas & Wanninkhof, Rik & Feely,
> Richard & Chris, Sabine & Olafsson, Jon & Nojiri, Yukihiro. (2002). Global
> sea-air CO2 flux based on climatological surface ocean pCO~2~, and seasonal

> in Oceanography. 49. 1601-1622. 10.1016/S0967-0645(02)00003-6.

(See the "Data_Review_And_Filtering" R Notebook for details on why and how we
calculated temperature-corrected pCO~2~ values.)

## Read Data
Note this version adjusts dates and times for Eastern Standard Time. It also
assigns each observation to a season based on month of the year.
```{r load_data} 
all_data <- read_csv(fpath,
                     col_types = cols(dd = col_integer(), 
                                      doy = col_integer(),
                                      hh = col_integer(),
                                      mm = col_integer(),
                                      yyyy = col_integer())) %>%
  select(c(datetime, temp, sal, do, omega_a)) %>%
  mutate(datetime = force_tz(datetime, tzone = 'UTC')) %>%
  
  # Calculate local standard time coordinates
  mutate(stdtime = structure(datetime, tzone = 'Etc/GMT+5')) %>%
  mutate(yyyy  = as.numeric(format(stdtime, format = '%Y')),
         mm    = as.numeric(format(stdtime, format = '%m')),
         dd    = as.numeric(format(stdtime, format = '%d')),
         doy   = as.numeric(format(stdtime, format = '%j')),
         hh    = as.numeric(format(stdtime, format = '%H')),
         Month = factor(mm, levels=1:12, labels = month.abb)
         ) %>%
  mutate(Season = recode_factor(mm, 
                                `1`  = 'Winter',
                                `2`  = 'Winter',
                                `3`  = 'Spring',
                                `4`  = 'Spring',
                                `5`  = 'Spring',
                                `6`  = 'Summer',
                                `7`  = 'Summer',
                                `8`  = 'Summer',
                                `9`  = 'Fall',
                                `10` = 'Fall',
                                `11` = 'Fall',
                                `12` = 'Winter'
                                ))

```

# Color Palette For Seasonal Displays
This is just a list, not a function like cbep_colors().
```{r seasonal_palette}
season_palette = c(cbep_colors()[1],
                    cbep_colors()[4],
                    cbep_colors()[2],
                    'orange')
```


# Seasonal Profiles
Only three changes here compared to the original draft graphics:

1.  The colors have been reordered to simplify making the colors correspond to
    the same years as in the FOCB graphics and
2.  The Y axis Legend has been simplified slightly.
3.  We have reformatted teh graphic to be smaller, to fit into
    design location on page layout.

## Aragonite Saturation State
```{r omega_by_doy, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 3}
plt <- ggplot(all_data, aes(doy, omega_a)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(yyyy)), alpha = 0.1) +
  
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 1), lty = 'solid', color = 'gray') +
  geom_text(aes(x=0, y=0.9, label= 'Omega = 1.0', hjust = 0), size=3) +
  
  xlab('') +
  ylab(expression('Carbonate Saturation (' ~ Omega[a] ~ ')')) +
  
  scale_color_manual(values=cbep_colors(), name='Year') +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = cutpoints, labels = month.abb) +
  
  guides(colour = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1, size = 2))) +
  
  theme_cbep(base_size = 11) +
  
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, vjust = 1.1)) +
  
  theme(legend.title =element_blank(), 
        legend.spacing.x = unit(.075, 'cm'),
        legend.position = 'top')
  
plt
#ggsave('figures/omegaSeasonal_cbep_smaller.png', type = 'cairo',
#       width = 3, height = 3)
ggsave('figures/omegaSeasonal_cbep_smaller.pdf', device=cairo_pdf,
       width = 3, height = 3)

```

# Diurnal Ribbon Plot
This is a new "Omega" diurnal plot, in case we want a graphic that slots into
the same location and style as the one we've already got.

This is an interesting graphic, but would be confusing to readers, as the point
of omega is its absolute value, not its diurnal fluctuation, so we won't use
this in SOCB 2020.

Besides, the lack of any winter omega data means this does not look much 
like the pH and PCO~2~ versions.

## Calculate Omega Deviations
For temperature-corrected pCO~2~.
```{r hourly_deviations_co2}
diurnal_data <- all_data %>%
  group_by(yyyy, mm, dd) %>%
  # Calculate sample sizes for each day.
  mutate(omega_a_n      = sum(! is.na(omega_a))) %>%
  
  # Calculate centered but not scaled values, day by day.
  mutate(omega_a_res      = scale(omega_a, scale = FALSE)) %>%
  ungroup(yyyy, mm, dd) %>%
  
  # Replace data from any days with less than 20 hours of data with NA
  mutate(omega_a_res      = ifelse(omega_a_n>=20, omega_a_res, NA)) %>%

  # Delete unnecessary data to save space
  select(-contains('_n')) %>%
  select(c(stdtime, yyyy, Season, Month, dd, hh, omega_a_res))
```

## Run the GAMM
The following takes ~ 8 minutes on a lightly loaded computer (Windows 10, 64
bit, Intel i7 processor, 2.4 GHz), and as long as 25 minutes when the machine
had lots of other things going on.  
```{r gamm_omega, cache = TRUE} 
system.time(omega_gam <- gamm(omega_a_res ~  s(hh, by = Season, bs='cc', k=6),
                 correlation = corAR1(form = ~ 1 | Season),  # we run out of memory if we don't use a grouping
                 data = diurnal_data))
```

## Generate Predictions from the Model
```{r predicts_co2}
newdat <- expand.grid(hh = seq(0, 23),
                    Season = c('Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall'))
p <- predict(omega_gam$gam, newdata = newdat, se.fit=TRUE)
newdat <- newdat %>%
  mutate(pred = p$fit, se = p$se.fit)
```

## Create Ribbon Graphic
The ribbon plot shows approximate 95% confidence intervals for the GAMM fits by
season.
```{r omega_ribbon, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(newdat, aes(x=hh, y=pred, color = Season)) + #geom_line() +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = pred-(1.96*se),
                  ymax = pred+(1.96*se),
                  fill = Season), alpha = 0.5,
              color = NA) +
  
  theme_cbep(base_size= 12) +
  theme(legend.key.width = unit(0.25,"in"),
        legend.text      = element_text(size = 8)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = season_palette, name = '') +
  
  xlab('Hour of Day') +
  ylab(expression(atop(Omega[a],Difference~From~Daily~Average)))

#   width = 4, height = 4)
