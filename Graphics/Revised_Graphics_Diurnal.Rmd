# WARNING: This Notebook Takes a Long Time to Run
Several complex models take between five and fifteen minutes each to run, so
"RUN All" OR "knit" may take twenty minutes or more to run.  The code is
designed to "cache" results after it has been "knit" once, so that is
principally a problem if you run the code in this notebook directly, change the
data or model specifications between "knits", or if you delete the cache files
from your computer.

# Introduction
This notebook and related notebooks document analysis of data derived from a
multi-year deployment of ocean acidification monitoring equipment at the
Southern Maine Community College pier, in South Portland.

The monitoring set up was designed and operated by Joe Kelly, of UNH and his
colleagues, on behalf of the Casco Bay Estuary Partnership.  This was one of the
first long-term OA monitoring facilities in the northeast, and was intended to
test available technologies as well as gain operational experience working with
acidification monitoring.

In this Notebook, we develop graphics looking at diurnal patterns of pCO~2~ and
pH, for Casco Bay Estuary partnership's 2020 State of the Bay report.  Companion
R Notebooks in the Analysis Folder look in greater detail at model selection and
uncertainty.

```

# Load Data 
The following code loads data already cleaned and reorganized, via the
"Data_Review_And_Filtering" R Notebook.  The data includes a "temperature
corrected" pCO2 value based on Takehashi et al. 2002.

## Establish Folder References
```{r folder_refs}
sibfldnm <- 'Derived_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
sibling  <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)

fn    <- 'CascoBayOAData.csv'
fpath <- file.path(sibling,fn)

dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

## Dealing with Time Zones
Note that the original time coordinate in the data received from UNH was in UTC,
not local time. But read_csv() interprets times according to the locale, here
Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Time, depending on time of year.  I
have not found an easy way to alter that behavior in read_csv(), but the
force_tz() function from lubridate can fix it.

The primary reason we would want to correct the time coordinate to local time is
that some version of local time is more appropriate for graphics showing the
effect of time of day on acidification parameters.  it is also important to make
sure that as we work with other external data sources (e.g., tides, river
discharge or weather) that all data uses the same time coordinate.

Note the series of datetime transformations here:  

1. The datetime is generated on import assuming (implicitly) local time zone,
which is incorrect. Our original data was in UTC.

2. The internal representation of the datetime object (POSIXct) is in seconds
since the beginning of 1970, at Greenwich (GMT or UTC), so it is independent of
timezone.  The 'tzone' attribute determines how that time is represented
externally, not how it is stored internally.  So, if we  just change the 'tzone'
attribute, we only change the external representation of the (still incorrect)
time that resulted from reading the data in with read_csv(). That would just
lead to greater confusion. We need to change the INTERNAL representation of the
time (as a number) while we also change the 'tzone' attribute.  That is what
lubridate's force_tz() function does.

3.  Finally, we need to convert to local time.  Here, we can just change the
'tzone' attribute. (We use the structure() function for its convenience in a
tidyverse pipeline.)

## Read the Data
```{r load_data} 
all_data <- read_csv(fpath,
                     col_types = cols(dd = col_integer(), 
                                      doy = col_integer(),
                                      hh = col_integer(),
                                      mm = col_integer(),
                                      yyyy = col_integer())) %>%
  select(c(datetime, yyyy, mm, dd, hh, doy, 
           temp, sal, do, ph, co2, co2_corr,
           omega_a, omega_c, TA_calc)) %>%
  mutate(datetime = force_tz(datetime, tzone = 'UTC')) %>%

  # "structure" function provides a way to specify or change attributes of an 
  # existing object. But its main value here is that unlike attr() <-, it can
  # readily be incorporated into mutate(). (One COULD call
  # `attr<-(x, which, value)` directly, but structure is simpler....)
  mutate(stdtime   = structure(datetime, tzone = 'Etc/GMT+5'),
         localtime = structure(datetime, tzone = 'America/New_York')) %>%
  
  # We calculate all date and time components based on local standard time.
  mutate(yyyy  = as.numeric(format(stdtime, format = '%Y')),
         mm    = as.numeric(format(stdtime, format = '%m')),
         dd    = as.numeric(format(stdtime, format = '%d')),
         doy   = as.numeric(format(stdtime, format = '%j')),
         hh    = as.numeric(format(stdtime, format = '%H')),
         Month = factor(mm, levels=1:12, labels = month.abb)
         ) %>%
  mutate(Season = recode_factor(mm, 
                                `1`  = 'Winter',
                                `2`  = 'Winter',
                                `3`  = 'Spring',
                                `4`  = 'Spring',
                                `5`  = 'Spring',
                                `6`  = 'Summer',
                                `7`  = 'Summer',
                                `8`  = 'Summer',
                                `9`  = 'Fall',
                                `10` = 'Fall',
                                `11` = 'Fall',
                                `12` = 'Winter'
                                ))
```

## Confirm Timezone Corrections
We quickly confirm that our efforts to adjust time coordinates had the intended
effect.

We compare UTC, local standard time (UTC - 5 hours) and local time (including
daylight savings time.)  For April, standard time should be five hours "behind"
UTC, while local time is in daylight savings, so should be four hours behind.

The first time stamp in the CSV file ('CascoBayOAData.csv') is 2015-4-23	15:00
(in UTC).
```{r small_test}
knitr::kable(all_data %>%
  select(datetime, stdtime, localtime) %>% 
  mutate_all(.funs = c(num=as.numeric)) %>% 
  select(datetime, datetime_num, stdtime, stdtime_num, localtime, localtime_num) %>%
  head())
```
Note that:  

1.  The first value of datetime matches the time stamp (in UTM) from the CSV
    file.  
2.  The internal representation of the three different times remains the same,
    but the text representation differs.  
3.  As required, std time is five hours behind datetime and local time is four
    hours behind. 

# pCO~2~ Graphics (Temperature Corrected) by Season
## Calculate pCO~2~ Deviations
For temperature-corrected pCO~2~.
```{r hourly_deviations_co2}
diurnal_data <- all_data %>%
  group_by(yyyy, mm, dd) %>%
  # Calculate sample sizes for each day.
  mutate(co2_n      = sum(! is.na(co2)),
         co2_corr_n = sum(! is.na(co2_corr)),
         ph_n       = sum(! is.na(ph))) %>%
  
  # Calculate centered but not scaled values, day by day.
  mutate(co2_res      = scale(co2, scale = FALSE),
         co2_corr_res = scale(co2_corr, scale = FALSE),
         ph_res       = scale(ph, scale = FALSE)) %>%
  ungroup(yyyy, mm, dd) %>%
  
  # Replace data from any days with less than 20 hours of data with NA
  mutate(co2_res      = ifelse(co2_n>=20, co2_res, NA),
         co2_corr_res = ifelse(co2_corr_n>=20, co2_corr_res, NA),
         ph_res       = ifelse(ph_n>=20, ph_res, NA)) %>%

  # Delete unnecessary data to save space
  select(-contains('_n')) %>%
  select(c(stdtime, yyyy, Season, Month, dd, hh, co2_corr_res))
```

## Run the GAMM
The following takes ~ 8 minutes on a lightly loaded computer (Windows 10, 64
bit, Intel i7 processor, 2.4 GHz), and as long as 25 minutes when the machine
had lots of other things going on.  
```{r gamm_pco2, cache = TRUE} 
system.time(pco2_gam <- gamm(co2_corr_res ~  s(hh, by = Season, bs='cc', k=6),
                 correlation = corAR1(form = ~ 1 | Season),  # we run out of memory if we don't use a grouping
                 data = diurnal_data))
```

## Generate Predictions from the Model
```{r predicts_co2}
newdat <- expand.grid(hh = seq(0, 23),
                    Season = c('Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall'))
p <- predict(pco2_gam$gam, newdata = newdat, se.fit=TRUE)
newdat <- newdat %>%
  mutate(pred = p$fit, se = p$se.fit)
```

## Create Ribbon Graphic
The ribbon plot shows approximate 95% confidence intervals for the GAMM fits by
season.
```{r co2_ribbon, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(newdat, aes(x=hh, y=pred, color = Season)) + #geom_line() +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = pred-(1.96*se),
                  ymax = pred+(1.96*se),
                  fill = Season), alpha = 0.5,
              color = NA) +
  
  theme_cbep(base_size= 12) +
  theme(legend.key.width = unit(0.25,"in"),
        legend.text      = element_text(size = 8)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = season_palette, name = '') +

  ylab(expression (atop(Corrected~pCO[2]~(mu*Atm), Difference~From~Daily~Average)))

#ggsave('figures/pco2_diurnal_seasons.png', type = 'cairo', width = 4, height = 4)
```

## Alternate Graphic with Lines
```{r co2_lines, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(newdat, aes(x=hh, y=pred)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = pred, color = Season), lwd = 1.5) +

         ph_res       = ifelse(ph_n>=20, ph_res, NA)) %>%

  # Delete unnecessary data to save memory
  select(-contains('_n')) %>%
