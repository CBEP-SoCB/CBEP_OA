## Ocean Acidification Data From SMCC
### Data Collected by UNH 

Data were collected by staff from Joe Salisbury's lab at UNH, with funding from the Casco Bay Estuary Partnership.

Data was collected at a site in the Southern Maine Community College Pier (approximately 43.6512	-70.2283). The location adjacent to the Portland Channel is hydrologically complex, influenced both by strong tides and river discharge from the Presumpscot River.

Automated sensors were deployed in a protective cage, resting on the bottom in approximately 2.5 meters of water.  The instruments were deployed periodically from 2015 through 2020.  Equipment was maintained, QA/QC samples collected, and data downloaded approximately monthly.  Here we report on data through the end of 2018.

Instrumentation consisted of the following
Parameters                           |     Instrument
-------------------------------------|-----------------
Conductivity, temperature, salinity  | Sea-Bird CTD 
-------------------------------------|-----------------       
pCO~2~                               | SunBurst SAMI-CO2
-------------------------------------|-----------------
pH (Total pH scale) and Temperature  | Satlantic SeaFET
-------------------------------------|-----------------
Dissolved oxygen, temperature,       | Aanderaa Oxygen
percent saturation                   | Optode
-------------------------------------|-----------------

Data was pre-processed by Chris Hunt, at UNH using standard analysis scripts to remove data collected before and after deployments, and calculate derived oA parameters (like carbonate saturation.

## Data Provenance
All data files analyzed here were received in an e-mail From Matt Liebman, sent to Curtis C. Bohlen on Sept. 16, 2019. E-mail Title:  FW:OA data Request.

The ZIP file contains original data as received, the other files were directly unzipped from there.

Weather data and tides data provide additional context for the OA observations. Additional DATA_SOURCES_.md files are contained within the sub-folders, documenting where those data were sourced.

Note that these data are a superset of data shared by Chris Hunt (of UNH) in 2020
