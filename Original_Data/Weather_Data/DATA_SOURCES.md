# Data Sources
## For Portland Jetport Weather 2015-2018
### Used for studying Coastal Acidification

Data was downloaded by Curtis C. Bohlen via a NOAA weather data API using a data access script "noaaportlandweatherdata2 (3).py"  (That progam is hand-edited to set filenames and download dates. A later version with a lightweight GUI is included in the CBEP SotB 2020 github archive for climate change.)

More details on the NOAA weather API are availalbe there.
